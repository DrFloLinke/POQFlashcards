[["index.html", "R Function Flashcards Preface", " R Function Flashcards Dr Flo Reiche Department of Politics and International Studies University of Warwick Last Updated 28 July, 2025 Preface Welcome to the collection of flashcards which should help you learn the purpose of R functions on all POQ-coded modules in PAIS for which I am responsible1. These are listed in the left-hand menu, and are subdivided by weekly content. The last section in Week 10 of each module tests all functions employed on the respective module. If you have any queries, please contact me at F.Reiche@warwick.ac.uk             The descriptions are either written by the author, or are taken from https://www.rdocumentation.org/ and https://r-coder.com/↩︎ "],["accessibility.html", "Accessibility", " Accessibility The companion uses the font “Lexend”. Lexend fonts are intended to reduce visual stress and so improve reading performance. Initially they were designed with dyslexia and struggling readers in mind, but Bonnie Shaver-Troup, creator of the Lexend project, soon found out that these fonts are also great for everyone else. The companion also uses a dark mode theme. For many users, including some neurodivergent individuals, dark mode can reduce eye strain and enhance focus by minimising visual overstimulation. Should you wish to increase or decrease the line spacing, you can do so by clicking the “A” symbol in the navigation menu.

"],["instructions.html", "Instructions Introduction View Existing Decks Create Your Own Decks", " Instructions Introduction You can revise the R Functions we use each week with the flashcards provided. But you might want to create your own deck of cards, for example with more difficult-to-remember functions. You might also want to render the flashcards in R Studio, so you can view them there, rather than on this page. View Existing Decks As a first step, download the .csv file from underneath the deck you wish to replicate in R Studio. Place this in a working directory, and use setwd to set the working directory in R. The package you need is called flashr which you need to install and load: install.packages(&quot;flashr&quot;) library(flashr) In order to create the deck of cards in R Studio, you need the flashcard function, which takes as its argument the name of the .csv file. For example, if you wanted to create a deck of cards with all the terms used on PO12Q, you would call: flashcard(&quot;PO12Q_Week 10_Consolidate.csv&quot;) Create Your Own Decks In order to create your own deck of cards with particularly “sticky” functions, you need to create your own .csv file. It is important that the first column is titled “term”, and the second column is titled “description”. Once you have created this .csv file, follow the instructioins in the previous Section.
